I produced these choropleth maps using d3 for a personal project looking at the demographics of neighborhoods in and around the proposed Brooklyn Queens Connector (BQX). This high speed railway will provide transportation between the two boroughs, however the projected route for the railway runs through more affluent, less populated neighborhoods that are already well served in regard to public transportation.
